# Sentence Splitting Tool

This sentence splitting tool is based on Logistic Regression model and tries to split sentences correctly in Turkish.

The target domain for the tool is general domain and there is variation in its performance from domain to domain.

The corpus used for training the model is a literary text so its performance is higher in literary domains compared to the others.

Known problems with the tool is the use of quotation marks. Use of quotation marks differ significantly, thus affecting the performance. Newer versions will be of higher performance in terms of quotation marks.

The abbreviations are for Turkish-only, thus only helping to increase performance in Turkish input.

An abbreviation list and a developed corpus for any other language will make the tool available in that language.
